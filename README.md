# Fiancial-inclusion-Group-1-project
This project aims to analyze the level and scope of financial inclusion in East Africa's demography by using bank account ownership as the main indicator of financial inclusion.


## Project Description

Financial Inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. The unbanked who are a majority in East Africa are left behind as they lack access to credit and financial services. This only furthers the poverty rate and slows down economic growth.

Traditionally, access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion. Despite the proliferation of mobile money in Africa and the growth of innovative fintech solutions, banks still play a pivotal role in facilitating access to financial services. Access to bank accounts enables households to save and facilitate payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness and improve their access to other financial services. Therefore, access to bank accounts is an essential contributor to long-term economic growth.


## Metric of Success

Our analysis will focus on descriptive statistics of the dataset to give insights on the state of financial inclusion in East Africa.
